	My student Max Rosmarin (Rosmarin, 2011) studied the question
	of whether using the left-leaning invariant would mix well
	with the Okasaki-style functional program, so as to factor the
	implementations and proofs. Rosmarin demonstrated that Okasaki's
	balance function can be factored into Sedgewick's three
	operations. Although it is not conceptually more complex, the
	factored function has more lines of code. Recall that Okasaki's
	function, as I presented it here, has only 10 lines, which
	is hard to improve on.
